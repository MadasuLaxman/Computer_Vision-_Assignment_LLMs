# Querying CSVs and Plotting Graphs with LLMs ðŸ¤–

This Streamlit application leverages large language models (LLMs) to query CSV files and generate visualizations. Users can upload their CSV files and interact with the data through natural language queries. The application uses the LangChain and Google Generative AI (Gemini-1.5-pro) to interpret the queries and execute the necessary commands.

## Features

- Upload CSV files and display the first few rows.
- Query the CSV data using natural language for statistical analysis.
- Generate visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and line plots based on user queries.
- Automatically execute Python code blocks returned by the LLM to generate plots.
